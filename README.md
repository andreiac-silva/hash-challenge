## Hash Challenge

Hey!! What's up? First of all, thank you for your time reviewing this code.
To make it easy, this parent repository contains the two projects which compose the Hash Challenge solution: product-service and discount-calculator.
<br/>
To execute the complete solution by docker-compose, run the following command line:

```shell script
$ docker-compose up
```

The projects' images were pushed on docker-hub, therefore, it's possible to run the whole solution without having the local code. Once the application is running, the API will be available on `localhost:8080`.

| METHOD       | RESOURCE    | HEADERS         |
|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| GET          |/product     | X-USER-ID (opt) |

<br/>
Some users' id can be retrieved accessing mongodb:

```shell script
$ docker exec -it mongo bash
$ mongo
$ db.getCollection('users').find({})
```
